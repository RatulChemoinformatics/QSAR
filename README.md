Title: Elucidating molecular mechanism and chemical space of chalcones through biological networks and machine learning approaches
Abstract: We developed a bio-cheminformatics method, exploring disease inhibition mechanisms using machine learning-enhanced quantitative structure-activity relationship (ML-QSAR) models and knowledge-driven neural networks. ML-QSAR models were developed using molecular fingerprint descriptors and the Random Forest algorithm to explore the chemical spaces of Chalcones inhibitors against diverse disease properties, including antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects. We generated and validated robust machine learning-based bioactivity prediction models (https://github.com/RatulChemoinformatics/QSAR) for the top genes. These models underwent ROC and applicability domain analysis, followed by molecular docking studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the molecules. Through comprehensive neural network analysis, crucial genes such as AKT1, HSP90AA1, SRC, and STAT3 were identified. The PubChem fingerprint-based model revealed key descriptors: PubchemFP521 for AKT1, PubchemFP180 for SRC, PubchemFP633 for HSP90AA1, and PubchemFP145 and PubchemFP338 for STAT3, consistently contributing to bioactivity across targets. Notably, chalcone derivatives demonstrated significant bioactivity against target genes, with compound RA1 displaying a predictive pIC50 value of 5.76 against HSP90AA1 and strong binding affinities across other targets. Compounds RA5 to RA7 also exhibited high binding affinity scores comparable to or exceeding existing drugs. These findings emphasize the importance of knowledge-based neural network-based research for developing effective drugs against diverse disease properties. These interactions warrant further in vitro and in vivo investigations to elucidate their potential in rational drug design. The presented models provide valuable insights for inhibitor design and hold promise for drug development. Future research will prioritize investigating these molecules for mycobacterium tuberculosis, enhancing the comprehension of effectiveness in addressing infectious diseases.
